Read the full blog that I have written on Neural Style Transfer here: [Neural Style Transfer in Python](https://medium.com/@rishabalagharu/neural-style-transfer-in-python-3327bc5ca1a6)

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that allows us to combine the artistic style of one image with the content of another, creating unique, stylized images from ordinary photos. NST opens up a world of creative possibilities!

My implementation of this uses the VGG-19 network, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is 19 layers deep and has been pretrained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.
